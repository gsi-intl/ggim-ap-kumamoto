For information about major hotels, please refer to information note or tourist information Website.<br>
<a href="http://kumanago.jp/en/spots/accommodation/search/?area_id=1" target="blank">Kumamoto Nagomi Tourism Site</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is necessary for participants to reserve hotel rooms for themselves. <br>
Host is providing information about the following three hotels of different types in terms of access to the meeting venue and fee.  <br>
Those who are considering attendance at the sixth Plenary Meeting are recommended to refer to these hotels and arrange accommodation immediately.  <br>
It is getting difficult to book a hotel room during the Plenary Meeting, as other events are scheduled near the venue at the same time.  <br>
Please note that the host does not arrange the booking for the participants now, since the block reservation tentatively made by host was closed at the end of July.  <br>   
 <br>
For hotel information, please visit tourist information Website Kumamoto Nagomi Tourism Site.  <br>
Participants are asked to book a room directly, however, if impossible, please inform the host. <br>
